# Storage Retention Policy

To manage storage costs and comply with limits (10GB Free Tier for R2), the following retention policies are enforced.

## 1. Raw Uploads
- **Retention Period**: 24 hours.
- **Description**: Original video files uploaded by users for processing.
- **Action**: Deleted automatically after processing is complete and the retention period expires.

## 2. Processed Outputs
- **Retention Period**: 30 days.
- **Description**: Final edited video files generated by the AI.
- **Action**: Deleted automatically after 30 days. Users are encouraged to download their videos promptly.

## 3. Thumbnails
- **Retention Period**: 30 days (aligned with outputs).
- **Description**: Preview images for jobs.

## 4. Cleanup Mechanism
- A background task runs daily (or hourly) to check identifying files exceeding their retention period.
- Logic is implemented in `StorageService.cleanup_old_files()`.
