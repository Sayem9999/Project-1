# ProEdit Constitution

## 📜 Core Mission
ProEdit is an **AI-Driven Video Editing Studio**, designed to replace traditional professional editing suites (like Adobe Premiere Pro or DaVinci Resolve) with specialized AI orchestration.

## 🚫 The "No-Generation" Doctrine
ProEdit is strictly a **POST-PRODUCTION** tool. We do not create content from thin air.

1.  **Strictly No Generative Content**: We do not generate AI images, AI videos, or AI avatars (e.g., Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, Luma, Runway). 
2.  **Strictly No Synthetic Narrative**: We do not "write stories" from scratch. We edit, refine, and structure **existing footage and user-provided context**.
3.  **Strictly AI-Driven Editing**: Our AI agents (Director, Cutter, Colorist, Audio Engineer) focus on:
    *   **Cutting & Pacing**: Finding the best moments in source footage.
    *   **Color & Aesthetics**: Grading and correcting existing visuals.
    *   **Audio Post**: Cleaning, ducking, and mastering existing sound.
    *   **Assembly**: Seamlessly orchestrating complex edits based on source media.

## 🎯 Target Outcome
ProEdit acts as a **Phantom Editor**. The user provides the raw material; ProEdit provides the professional finish.

## ⚖️ Rule of Law
All AI Agents in this workspace are bound by this Constitution. Any proposal to add "generative" capabilities must be rejected as an unconstitutional deviation from the core mission.
